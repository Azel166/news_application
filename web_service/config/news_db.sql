After a brief decrease in March, the number of deaths worldwide is on the rise again, with an average of approximately 12,000 deaths, approaching the 14,500 daily death toll (7-day rolling average) recorded at the end of January.\r\nCountries such as the US and the UK have seen their number of new daily deaths falling since late January due to vaccination campaigns, whereas India and Brazil are facing unprecedented surges in infections.\r\nWHO calls for &#39;reality check&#39; as global Covid-19 cases surge for seventh week\r\nWHO calls for \'reality check\' as global Covid-19 cases surge for seventh week\r\nIn Brazil, some 3,000 deaths are reported every day, accounting for almost a quarter of the deaths reported daily in the world.

On that day, June 17, a total 2,003 deaths were recorded in a single day due to clerical errors resulting in a backlog.\r\nAccording to JHU there are 140 million global cases of Covid-19.', '2021-04-17', 1),
(2, 'The world\'s biggest vaccine producer is running out of Covid-19 vaccines, as second wave accelerates', 'In India, the world\'s biggest vaccine producer, millions of people are waiting for Covid-19 vaccines amid a devastating second wave of infections.', ' By Jessie Yeung and Esha Mitra', '(CNN)In India, the world\'s biggest vaccine producer, millions of people are waiting for Covid-19 vaccines amid a devastating second wave of infections.\r\n\r\nIndia typically produces more than 60% of all vaccines sold globally, and is home to the Serum Institute of India (SII), the world\'s largest vaccine maker. Its vast manufacturing capability is why the country signed on as a major player in COVAX, the global vaccine-sharing initiative that provides discounted or free doses for lower-income countries. Under the initial agreement announced last year, SII would manufacture up to 200 million doses for up to 92 countries.\r\nBut the situation in India is markedly different from just a few months ago. Its second wave began in March, quickly surpassing the first, which had peaked last September at more than 97,000 coronavirus cases a day.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, the country reported 217,353 new cases -- its highest single-day figure so far, according to data from the Indian Ministry of Health. India added a million new cases in less than a week, surpassing 14 million total cases on Thursday.\r\nStates and cities are imposing new restrictions, including weekend and nighttime curfews in the capital region Delhi, home to 19 million people. Migrant workers are also leaving major cities en masse for their home villages, afraid any potential lockdowns will leave them stranded.\r\nAnd through it all, vaccine supplies have dried up on the ground, with at least five states reporting severe shortages and urging the federal government to act.\r\nIn the face of crisis, the government and SII have shifted focus from supplying vaccines to COVAX to prioritizing their own citizens at home.\r\n\"Deliveries of doses from the Serum Institute of India will be delayed in March and April,\" said COVAX, which is run by a coalition including international vaccine organization Gavi and the World Health Organization, in a news release on March 25. \"Delays in securing supplies of SII-produced Covid-19 vaccine doses are due to the increased demand for Covid-19 vaccines in India.\"\r\nBoxes of the AstraZeneca vaccine, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India and provided through the COVAX global initiative, arrive in Mogadishu, Somalia on March 15.\r\nBoxes of the AstraZeneca vaccine, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India and provided through the COVAX global initiative, arrive in Mogadishu, Somalia on March 15.\r\nIndia had provided 28 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine so far, and was scheduled to deliver another 40 million doses in March and 50 million in April, the release said, adding that COVAX and the Indian government \"remain in discussions\" about completing supplies.\r\nIt\'s not the first time India had to pause its COVAX contributions: in January, the government restricted the export of AstraZeneca vaccines produced by SII \"because they want to prioritize for the most vulnerable and needy segments first,\" SII CEO Adar Poonawalla.\r\nBut these repeated delays have hit poor countries hard. The director of Africa\'s disease control body warned India\'s hold on exports could be \"catastrophic\" for the continent -- while Pakistan, one of the biggest program recipients, decided to allow private vaccine imports and sales to fill the gap.\r\nVaccination centers turning people away\r\nIndia is administering two vaccines domestically: the Oxford-AstraZeneca one, also known as Covishield, and its homegrown Covaxin, developed jointly by Bharat Biotech and the government-run Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)\r\nThe country started its vaccination program in January for health care workers and priority groups, with the goal of fully inoculating 300 million people by August. But the program had a sluggish start, facing logistical issues as well as vaccine hesitancy among the population -- especially towards Covaxin, which was approved for emergency use before the efficacy data of its third phase trial were released.\r\nTo date, only 14.3 million people have been fully vaccinated -- just over 1% of India\'s population of 1.3 billion, according to Johns Hopkins University.\r\nBut public confidence rose as the government stepped up an awareness campaign to assuage concerns, and the vaccination program picked up speed. As new daily cases accelerated in March and April, several states began reporting major vaccine shortages.\r\n\r\nIn Odisha, nearly 700 vaccination centers had to close last week due to shortages, wrote health authorities in a letter to the central government, warning the state would soon exhaust its available stock.\r\nRajesh Bhaskar, a health official in Punjab, told CNN last week the state had about 450,000 doses of Covishield and 30,000 doses of Covaxin. The state is home to more than 27 million people, according to the government\'s latest available statistics. \"We want to vaccinate about 100,000 people per day at least, and the current supply is insufficient to meet that demand,\" he said.\r\nSeveral districts in Maharashtra, the worst-hit state, had to temporarily suspend vaccination drives, including more than 70 centers in Mumbai that shut last week, according to the state\'s health minister, Rajesh Tope. Maharashtra had administered more than 11.1 million doses as of Thursday, the most of any Indian states, according to the Indian Ministry of Health.\r\n\"In both cities and villages, we have created teams ... to bring all those above 45 years old to take the vaccine,\" Tope said on April 7. \"People are coming to the centers, but our healthcare workers have to tell them that they haven\'t received the vaccine so they should go home.\"\r\nThere are several challenges contributing to the shortages -- one being the supply of raw materials, said former ICMR director general Nirmal Kumar Ganguly.\r\nIndia \"has the capacity to produce,\" Ganguly added, but supply chains have been disrupted during the pandemic. The vaccine formulas and required materials \"cannot be changed overnight, so we have to rely on the raw materials being imported.\"\r\nThe US has placed a temporary ban on exporting raw materials critical for vaccine production -- and the EU has similarly tightened restrictions around vaccine exports. India is now working to \"adapt to the materials which are made at home or the neighboring countries like Singapore,\" but this will take time, said Ganguly.\r\nAn additional challenge is the country\'s reliance on SII, he added. There are other vaccine manufacturers in the country, such as Bharat Biotech, but SII remains the largest.\r\n\"The need has been glaringly brought out that we need to expand our capacity,\" Ganguly said. \"We are one of the vaccine exporters but these are done by two or three Indian companies at the moment, the rest of them are not big players and some of them are totally new in vaccine production.\"\r\nGovernment\'s mixed response\r\nSeveral states have requested more doses from the central government -- but federal officials have pushed back, insisting the situation is under control.\r\nTope\'s complaints were \"nothing but an attempt to divert attention from Maharashtra government\'s repeated failures to control the spread of pandemic,\" said Indian Health Minister Harsh Vardhan in a statement last week. Home Minister Amit Shah also refuted states\' claims, saying their information was \"not true\" and vaccines were available, \"as much as is required.\"\r\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi has made a point of praising India\'s vaccination effort as a success. During a meeting with state governors on Wednesday, Modi \"highlighted that India has become the fastest nation to reach the landmark of 10 crore vaccinations (100 million doses),\" according to a statement from his office.\r\nIndia took 85 days to reach 100 million doses. By comparison, the US took 89 days and China 102 days, according to Modi\'s office.\r\nAnd on Tuesday, Rajesh Bhushan, the health ministry\'s secretary, said the problem was poor planning and management -- not supply. \"We are making doses available to states in a timely manner,\" he said, adding that states should \"look at how many unutilized doses there are at each cold chain point.\"\r\nTheir statements were met with outrage from local and state leaders. Shah\'s assertion was \"factually completely incorrect,\" tweeted Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on April 10.\r\nAnd though a last-minute shipment from the central government had saved Uttarakhand from a complete shortage, it\'s far from a perfect solution and \"the supply is unpredictable,\" said health department official Kuldeep Martolia on Monday.\r\nIn a sign the federal government may be feeling the pressure, it took action this week to open the doors for vaccine imports. On Tuesday, it announced it would fast-track emergency approvals for vaccines already approved by the World Health Organization or authorities in the United States, Europe, Britain and Japan.\r\nCompanies still need to apply for approval in India, but they will be exempt from having to conduct local safety trials, expediting the process.\r\n\"If any of these regulators have approved a vaccine, the vaccine is now ready to be brought into the country for use, manufacture and fill-and-finish,\" Dr. VK Paul, a senior health official at the government-run think tank Niti Aayog, said at a news conference on Tuesday. \"We hope and we invite the vaccine makers such as Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson and others ... to be ready to come to India as early as possible.\"\r\nThe move is \"a calculated step\" by the government to \"ensure we have more vaccines available,\" said Ganguly. The government could also expand its supply through the private market -- but this brings additional challenges too, he said, including the question of how to price vaccines to provide equitable access to the poor.\r\nBut even the possibility of importing foreign vaccines won\'t be a quick fix, since companies like Pfizer and Moderna have other orders to fulfill first, including supplying vaccines for the US. India just granted emergency use authorization for Russia\'s Sputnik vaccine -- but \"by the time they build up manufacturing capacities and manufacturing requirements, it will be five to six months,\" Ganguly said.\r\nIn the meantime, the government is working to expand local production capacity -- a state-run biomedical institute in Maharashtra was given the green light to manufacture the Covaxin vaccine on Thursday, through a transfer of technology with Bharat Biotech.\r\nA Sadhu wearing a face mask takes a holy dip in the Ganges River during the Kumbh Mela festival in Haridwar, India, on April 12.\r\nA Sadhu wearing a face mask takes a holy dip in the Ganges River during the Kumbh Mela festival in Haridwar, India, on April 12.\r\nAll the while, the second wave roils on, with cases climbing sharply every day. Millions of people are traveling across the country to the city of Haridwar in Uttarakhand for the Kumbh Mela, a Hindu festival and the largest pilgrimage on Earth. Despite warnings of the Covid risks, huge crowds are gathering to hold prayers, attend ceremonies and take holy dips in the Ganges River.\r\nAlready, cases in Haridwar are spiking -- prompting the state to impose new restrictions on Thursday. At least one religious group attending the festival, the Niranjani Akhada, has asked those from out of state to pull back amid the rise in cases.\r\n\"This surge is a very, very threatening sight which is happening at this given moment in India,\" said Ganguly. \"We have never seen anything like this before.\"', '2021-04-18', 1),

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif accused Israel of sabotaging the facility and vowed to take revenge.\r\nThe decision pushes Iran closer to reaching the 90% enrichment level that is considered weapons-grade.

(5, 'The 2020 election still hovers over the Supreme Court with another pending Pennsylvania case', 'Five months after the presidential election and nearly 100 days into President Joe Biden\'s term, the Supreme Court is still considering whether to take up a case related to voting rights in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.', 'By Ariane de Vogue, CNN Supreme Court Reporter', '(CNN)Five months after the presidential election and nearly 100 days into President Joe Biden\'s term, the Supreme Court is still considering whether to take up a case related to voting rights in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nSo far, the justices declined several requests to dive into one of the most litigious elections in history, denying petitions from then-President Donald Trump and other Republicans seeking to overturn election result in multiple states Biden won.\r\nBut at their closed-door conference on Friday the justices discussed a case that has been lingering on the docket since just after the election, brought by a former GOP congressional candidate concerning a state Supreme Court decision that allowed an expansion of ballot deadlines amidst the pandemic.\r\nTrump\'s name isn\'t on the case and the court\'s action wouldn\'t impact the last election. But the justices surely know that if they engage now, even with a promise to look toward future elections, the former President would likely link their action to his own loss.\r\n\"With the election finally settled, the justices might believe now is the time to wade into the issue, though certainly they may prefer to do so in a case where the word \'Trump\' would not have to be uttered and give the former president more fodder to advance the false claim that he actually won the election,\" said election law expert Richard L. Hasen of the University of California, Irvine School of Law.\r\nIt was a hotly debated issue in the weeks before and after the election as some Republicans charged that state courts might not have the final say on their state voting rules. The arguments goes that the Constitution gives the state legislature -- not the governor or state courts -- the final word on elections and the manner by which states choose electors. Critics of the so called \"independent state legislature\" doctrine say that \"legislature\" is a broad term including commissions given legislative powers by the state constitution.\r\nAfter the election, Trump invited leaders of the Pennsylvania legislature to the White House as he continued to make baseless claims that widespread voter fraud had occurred although no court agreed. Biden won the state by roughly 82,000 votes.\r\nAlthough the court never waded into the election, on February 22, three justices, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch dissented when their colleagues declined to take up similar cases concerning the same Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision.\r\nThe cases, Alito said, present \"important and recurring constitutional question\" that should be determined. \"Now the election is over, and there is no reason for refusing to decide the important question that these cases pose,\" he added. And while Justice Brett Kavanaugh sided with the conservatives in an early point in the dispute, neither he nor Amy Coney Barrett provided the necessary vote last winter.\r\n\"A majority of Supreme Court justices could well believe that state legislatures have extraordinary power when it comes to setting the rules for federal elections, even if it means overruling state supreme courts relying on state constitutions to limit legislative power,\" Hasen said. \"It would be a remarkable shift in election power in the states.\"\r\nRepublicans claimed that state legislatures had been cut out of the process of setting the rules for federal elections.\r\nThe case is brought by a former republican congressional candidate, Jim Bognet, and four individual voters who argued the state high court exceeded its authority when it ordered the expansion amidst the pandemic.\r\nIn court papers, they make clear that the case is forward looking -- not meant to impact the last election but future challenges going forward. But it comes as the former president is still bitter that the Supreme Court did not step into reverse election results, raising the possibility that if the court agrees to take up the case Trump will react once again rekindling battles over the 2020 election.\r\nThe 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed this case holding that the challengers did not have the legal right to bring the case. The challengers are asking the Supreme Court to reverse that decision and hold that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court usurped the Pennsylvania General Assembly\'s authority when it changed voting rules prescribed by the legislature.\r\n\"This case presents an opportunity for the court to resolve these issues in an orderly manner on full briefing and argument, rather than on the \"shadow docket\" under the time pressures of an ongoing election,\" David Thompson, a lawyer for Bognet, argued in court papers.\r\nThe Supreme Court&#39;s key Second Amendment opinion and what might come next\r\nThe Supreme Court\'s key Second Amendment opinion and what might come next\r\nThe Constitution places the authority to set the rules for federal elections in the hands of the \"state legislatures -- not . . . state judges, not state governors, not other state official.\" Thompson argued. He said that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court \"rewrote\" election deadlines. Besides the constitutional question Thompson is also asking the justices to decide definitively what parties have the legal right to bring such challenges and to revisit the circumstances when courts should step in even if the case comes close to an election.\r\n\"Although Election Day has passed, the disputes around these questions are not going away,\" Thompson said.\r\nDon Verrilli, who served as solicitor general during the Obama administration, represents the Democratic National Committee which is one of the parties in the case.\r\n\"Because that election is now fully complete, and the remedy in question had no effect on any federal electoral result,\" Verrilli argued, the challenge is moot. He said if the court were to step in now, it would be issuing an \"advisory opinion\" about the conduct of future elections\" and he noted that the court has already declined to take up other cases concerning the same Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision.\r\n\"This court,\" Verrilli said, \"has no power to settle abstract legal questions that do not implicate any actual case or controversy.\"\r\nRobert Wiygul, representing the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, told the justices they should not step in. He said that the state high court responded in the midst of the pandemic and severe Postal Service delays in order to stop the potential disenfranchisement of Pennsylvania voters. Plus, he said, the total number of ballots that the petitioners are challenging is less than the margin of victory in each of Pennsylvania\'s federal races and that the vote total certified did not include the disputed ballots.', '2021-04-18', 3),

That means these Wall Street firms won\'t be able to buy or underwrite these crucial transactions by Russia\'s central government.\r\nThis marks a significant escalation of US sanctions on Russia and will make it more difficult for Moscow to raise capital.

The new Tennessee plant is expected to open in late 2023 and employ 1,300 workers, said GM CEO Mary Barra.\r\nThe Spring Hill investment and the battery plants \"demonstrate we\'re committed to changing the world right now,\" said Barra. \"A fundamental shift in transportation is taking place and General Motors will lead the way. We\'re seeing growing enthusiasm from all corners.\"\r\nVirtually all automakers are ramping up production plans for electric vehicles, both to meet increasingly tougher environmental regulations as well as increasing demand among car buyers. Electric cars have fewer moving parts than gas-powered vehicles, and therefore can be cheaper to build because they require less labor.\r\nEV battery shortage ahead\r\nBut there is a looming shortage of the batteries needed to power the cars. The lack of inventory could put upward pressure on battery prices, and keep the cost of EVs higher than traditional gasoline cars.\r\n\"We\'re working to make sure we have adequate supply [of batteries] all the way from the mines,\" Barra told investors in February when discussing GM results. \"It\'s one of the reasons why we\'re investing in our own [battery] cell manufacturer .... We want to be in control of our own destiny ... making sure we have the ability to have the cells that we need.\"\r\nBut all automakers are scrambling to find the supply of batteries they\'ll need for their EV plans. Even with its own battery plant in Nevada that has been up and running for years, electric car leader Tesla (TSLA) said it needs more batteries from suppliers. It also said that a lack of batteries is the reason it has yet to come out with an electric semi-tractor truck, which will need five times as many batteries as a typical EV.\r\nAt the beginning of this year the Center for Automotive Research estimated that current North American EV output could be satisfied with 30 gigawatts of batteries annually. That could increase to 140 gigawatts in just five to six years, and could rise further with incentive proposals from the Biden administration to encourage electric car purchases. Even with Friday\'s announcement about the new Tennesee plant, current plans for investment get the industry to only about 120 gigawatts of annual capacity.\r\nBrett Smith, director of technology for the Center for Automotive Research, a Michigan think tank, said that until recently he didn\'t think there would be an shortage of EV batteries. Now, such a shortage is not only likely but perhaps inevitable.\r\n\"My perspective has changed significantly in the last six months. These companies are truly putting their money where their mouths are. This change is happening,\" he said about EV production plans. But it will be difficult for the battery supply to keep up with those more ambitious EV plans.\r\n\"Building the plant isn\'t a huge problem. But making sure the supply lines are available for that quantity of raw materials and chemicals is a much bigger challenge,\" he said.\r\nWhere will batteries come from, who will build them\r\nThe Biden administration has identified EV batteries as one of the four supply chain segments, along with computer chips, pharmaceuticals and some rare earths and other raw materials, in which the US government will work to encourage domestic production rather than relying on international sources from China and elsewhere.\r\nGM\'s only EV available for sale at US dealerships, the Chevrolet Bolt, gets its battery imported from South Korea. But that is a different, less expensive battery than the ones to be built in Ohio and Tennessee. Those will be GM\'s new Ultium battery that will be the basis of its upcoming electric vehicles such electric Hummers and the Cadillac Lyriq.\r\nWho will build the batteries -- and how much they\'ll be paid -- remains an active question.\r\nGM and LG already had a Michigan plant that built batteries for the discontinued plug-in hybrid Volt.

So many memories since then. \"\r\nOthers shared similar stories. Personally, that would include seeing \"The Wind and the Lion\" as a kid back in the mid-1970s, watching Sean Connery -- who will be among the standout names in this year\'s Academy Awards \"In Memoriam\" segment -- wield a sword in epic, swashbuckling fashion.\r\nThe Oscars have always served as what amounts to a primetime commercial for the movies, celebrating their past as well as their present and promoting them to a global audience. But while a year of pandemic-related shutdowns hasn\'t dampened enthusiasm for escaping into entertainment, it has placed dark clouds over the future of theaters, and whether people fed a steady diet of streaming content into their homes will be lured out of them as readily, especially if public-health concerns about mass gatherings and crowded indoor spaces linger.\r\nThe conversation on social media immediately turned to efforts to \"save\" the Cinerama Dome in particular, and it seems possible that someone will, whether that\'s a consortium or an entity like Netflix -- which bought Hollywood\'s Egyptian Theatre last year -- recognizing the goodwill that would come from ensuring the survival of such a historic landmark.\r\nThe broader question of what happens to movies and movie going, however, remains a mystery. Seemingly, every encouraging sign -- such as the pandemic-best box-office results in the US for \"Godzilla vs. Kong,\" a film whose big names cry out for a screen of similar stature -- has been balanced by a cautionary disclaimer, delayed release or some other step backward.\r\nAward shows have struggled in this environment, and the disappointing ratings for the Grammys and Golden Globes have fueled bleak forecasts for the Oscars, which will air on April 25. Organizers of the event have nevertheless forged ahead with what they hope will be a less-virtual presentation, which might lift spirits but probably won\'t do much to boost tune-in.\r\nStill, if the reaction to the Arclight and Pacific news indicates anything, it\'s that the movie industry is at a tenuous crossroads, giving the celebratory aspect of the awards a clearer and more urgent mission.\r\nWhatever wins best picture this year will almost certainly have achieved its widest exposure among people watching on a couch, not in a theater seat. As the film business gears up for a summer and fall with considerably higher hopes than 2020 offered, reminding people not just of what they saw, but also what they\'ve been missing, could be the most important task that these Oscars can accomplish.', '2021-04-13', 4),

He moved seamlessly from formal navy uniform and black-tie attire to laid-back outfits better suited to family shooting weekends at Balmoral castle in Scotland.\r\nHis gentlemanly approach to fashion meant that over 73 years of his marriage to Queen Elizabeth II, his ensembles complemented but never overshadowed her.\r\nTo Dylan Jones, editor-In-chief of GQ and menswear chairman of the British Fashion Council, the duke was a \"true sartorial connoisseur\" who \"always dressed according to the rules.\"\r\n\"He had dignity, style and decorum,\" Jones wrote via email.\r\nThroughout his life Prince Philip would call on the services of many of the established and palace-approved ateliers on London\'s Savile Row. Perfectly cut suits, often fitted by his longtime tailor John Kent, were of course a staple in his wardrobe. His robemaker was London\'s oldest tailor, Ede & Ravenscroft, which was established in 1689, while Davies & Son handled his military attire and Gieves & Hawkes his naval dress. For kilts, the Prince Philip regularly enlisted the services of Kinloch Anderson in Edinburgh.\r\nWhile his impeccable standards are what defined his style, older photos of a young Philip show he wasn\'t afraid to have fun with his sartorial choices.\r\nMost British men in the 1940s preferred a clean-shaven look, but a candid portrait taken during a naval visit to Australia in 1945 reveals a bearded Philip in his mid-20s, smiling mischievously into the camera. Six years later, while on a royal tour in Canada, the duke danced at a traditional hoedown in blue jeans, a plaid shirt and a neckerchief to complete the look.\r\nPrince Philip is pictured dancing at a traditional hoedown held in the honour of the Royal Couple at Rideau Hall, Ottawa, during a five-week visit of Canada in 1951. \r\nA fan of cricket, polo and various water sports, he was often spotted in sportswear. A black-and-white photo taken in Turkey in 1951 during a summer cruise with the Royal Navy shows a svelte Prince Philip jumping off a set of water skis onto dry land, one of many action shots snapped of the handsome royal throughout his younger years.\r\nPrince Philip\'s preferred color palette was mostly muted, but his outfit for his 25th wedding anniversary with the Queen offered a rare splash of color. Their silver wedding celebrations took place in 1972 aboard the Royal Yacht Britannia, and in one photograph, the smiling couple are in visible holiday-mode, sunglasses and all. The Queen is pictured smiling brightly at her husband who is dressed in a boldly printed blue short-sleeved shirt and chinos.\r\nAs the longest serving consort in British history, Prince Philip was dutiful in life and style and will be remembered for his astute choices and his ability to use fashion to honor the spirit of almost any moment.\r\nHe was recognized for that ability in 2016, when he made it onto GQ\'s \"50 Best-Dressed Men in Britain\" list at the age of 94. Coming in at number 12, he even outranked his grandson Prince Harry who was placed 38th.\r\nWhen asked what secured the duke\'s spot high on the list, Jones said, \"His attention to detail and for always dressing like a gentleman.

The Grand National is regarded as the most grueling and spectacular steeplechase in the world.\r\nWhile media attention has focused on the sporting milestone her success represents, the first woman to have won the Grand National says that wasn\'t on her mind as she crossed the finishing line.\r\n\"You\'re just the winning jockey and you\'re just ecstatic,\" she says. \"I\'m under no illusions that it is [a milestone] when you\'re the first person to do anything, it\'s going to be a talking point.\r\n\"And, I hope it helps the industry, it helps other jockeys, other female jockeys, but on a personal level, I was just delighted to win the race.\"\r\n\'Extremely lucky\'\r\nBlackmore points to the strides made by female jockeys before her, and how it fostered a receptive environment for when she, and other women entered the sport.\r\n\"I\'ve been extremely lucky,\" she says. \"I think the achievements mainly of Katie Walsh and Nina Carberry when I was entering the weight room.\r\n\"They\'d ridden multiple winners, Irish Grand National winners. Their achievements had kind of broken down any stigma that may have been lingering in the background.\r\n\"It was very much a welcoming place for me to go into, and a level place, and I think racing should be very proud of that, that there is equal opportunity there. If you\'re willing, male, or female, if you\'re willing to work hard and if you have the talent, you will be given the opportunity.\"\r\n\r\nHowever given only three out of the 40 jockeys were female at Saturday\'s Grand National suggests there is still work to be done when it comes to equal opportunities in the sport.\r\nBlackmore disagrees, and feels personal choice is the more likely factor for the gender disparity in the race.\r\n\"People can forget it\'s maybe not a career that a lot of women in the industry, or girls starting out, want to pursue, and that\'s just that\'s just the way it is,\" she says.\r\n\"I think if there are girls out there that do want to do it, I really don\'t think gender can be used as any kind of a deterrent or an excuse for them to achieve what they want to achieve at this stage.\r\n\"It\'s a done deal.

(18, 'SpaceX Wins NASA $2.9 Billion Contract to Build Moon Lander', 'Elon Musk’s company bested Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin and others in the contest to carry American astronauts to the lunar surface.', 'By Kenneth Chang', 'Elon Musk’s private space company is developing a giant rocket called Starship to one day take people to Mars.\r\n\r\nBut first, it will drop off NASA astronauts at the moon.\r\n\r\nNASA announced on Friday that it had awarded a contract to SpaceX for $2.9 billion to use Starship to take astronauts from lunar orbit to the surface of the moon.\r\n\r\nThe contract extends NASA’s trend of relying on private companies to ferry people, cargo and robotic explorers to space. But it also represents something of a triumph for Mr. Musk in the battle of space billionaires. One of the competitors for the NASA lunar contract was Blue Origin, created by Jeffrey P. Bezos of Amazon.\r\n\r\nSpaceX now outshines Blue Origin and other rocket builders, emphasizing how it has become the highest-profile partner of NASA in its human spaceflight program.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen NASA achieves the goal of landing the next astronauts on the moon as part of its Artemis program — now promised by the Biden administration to include the first woman and the first person of color there — they are likely to be riding in a SpaceX vehicle.\r\n\r\n“We are confident in NASA’s partnership with SpaceX to help us achieve the Artemis mission,” Lisa Watson-Morgan, the program manager at NASA overseeing development of the landers, said during a telephone news conference on Friday, “and look forward to continuing our work toward landing astronauts on the moon to prepare for the next giant leap towards Mars.”\r\n\r\nNews of the award was reported earlier in The Washington Post.\r\n\r\nNASA last year awarded contracts to three companies for initial design work on landers that could carry humans to the lunar surface. In addition to SpaceX, NASA selected proposals from Dynetics, a defense contractor in Huntsville, Ala., and Mr. Bezos’ Blue Origin, which had joined in what it called the National Team with several traditional aerospace companies: Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Draper.\r\n\r\nThe award is only for the first crewed landing, and SpaceX must first perform an uncrewed landing. “NASA is requiring a test flight to fully check out all systems with a landing on the lunar surface prior to our formal demonstration mission,” Ms. Watson-Morgan said.\r\n\r\nNASA officials said Blue Origin, Dynetics and other companies would be able to bid for future moon landing missions.\r\n\r\nKathy Lueders, NASA’s associate administrator for human exploration and operations called it the “best strategy” for NASA at this point in time to award the contract to one company, “and then begin discussions with industry about how to further develop additional competition out there for a future services contract.”\r\n\r\nPresident Biden is sustaining plans started under President Donald J. Trump to send astronauts back to the moon. But while Mr. Trump pledged a return by 2024, the schedule was not considered realistic after Congress did not provide requested financing, and NASA is now re-evaluating the schedule.\r\n\r\nThe NASA Artemis program is expected to launch its first uncrewed trip either later this year or early next year, using a powerful rocket called the Space Launch System to propel the Orion capsule, where future astronauts will be sitting, on a trip to the moon and back. The booster stage of the rocket passed an important ground test last month.\r\n\r\nFor the spacecraft that would land astronauts on the moon, NASA had been expected to choose two of the three companies to move forward and build their landers, mirroring the approach the space agency has used for hiring companies to take cargo and now astronauts to the International Space Station. Two options provide competition that helps keep costs down, and provides a backup in case one of the systems encounters a setback.\r\n\r\n\r\nImageAn artist’s concept of Blue Origin’s Blue Moon spacecraft and astronauts on the moon.\r\nAn artist’s concept of Blue Origin’s Blue Moon spacecraft and astronauts on the moon.Credit...Blue Origin\r\nNASA officials suggested that budget constraints — Congress in the current fiscal year appropriated only about one-fourth of the financing that had been requested for the development of the landers — shaped their decision.\r\n\r\n“We believe this is doable within what we what we have and what we can expect in funding,” said Steve Jurczyk, the acting administrator of NASA.\r\n\r\nIn choosing just SpaceX, NASA officials also seem to be saying they believe that Mr. Musk’s company can deliver on an ambitious spacecraft design, one that is far larger and more capable than what NASA actually needs. Indeed, once Starship starts operations, it would raise questions why NASA needs the Space Launch System rocket at all.\r\n\r\nEach launch of the Space Launch System is expected to cost more than $1 billion. Because Starship is designed to be fully reusable, its costs will be far cheaper.\r\n\r\nThe Artemis plans currently call for the astronauts to launch into orbit on top of a Space Launch System rocket. The upper stage of the rocket is to then propel the Orion capsule, where the astronauts will be sitting, toward the moon.\r\n\r\nUnlike NASA’s Apollo moon missions in the 1960s and 1970s, the lander spacecraft is to be sent separately to lunar orbit. Orion is to dock with the lander, which will then head to the surface.\r\n\r\nBut Starship will dwarf Orion in size, making the architecture similar to sailing a yacht across the Atlantic Ocean and then switching to a cruise ship for the short ride into port.\r\nStarship, in principle, can take astronauts all the way from Earth to the moon without as much of the elaborate choreography of docking. Starship will need to be refueled with methane and liquid oxygen in orbit.\r\n\r\nA Japanese billionaire, Yusaku Maezawa, has bought an around-the-moon flight on Starship. That trip, which could occur as soon as 2023, would only pass by the moon and not land.\r\n\r\nSpaceX has been launching a series of high-altitude tests of Starship prototypes at its site at the southern tip of Texas, not far outside Brownsville, to perfect how the spacecraft would return to Earth. SpaceX has made great progress with the maneuver of belly-flopping to slow its fall, but the tests so far have all ended explosively.\r\n\r\nMr. Musk recently pledged that the spacecraft would be ready to fly people to space by 2023, although he has a track record of overpromising and underdelivering on rocket development schedules.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket has become the workhorse of American and international spaceflight with its reusable booster stage. The company has twice carried astronauts to the International Space Station for NASA, and it is scheduled to loft a third crew there on Thursday.\r\n\r\nNumerous private satellite operators have relied on the company to carry their payloads to orbit. And another company, Astrobotic, announced this week that it had picked a larger SpaceX rocket, Falcon Heavy, to carry a NASA rover called VIPER to the moon’s south pole to prospect for ice in the coming years.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, the Biden administration also announced the nomination of Pamela Melroy, a former astronaut, to become NASA’s deputy administrator. Last month, Bill Nelson, a former Florida senator, was nominated to be administrator.', '2021-04-16', 9),

That\'s why we take protecting confidentiality incredibly seriously.\"\r\n\r\nJANE NORBERG, CHIEF OF THE SEC\'S WHISTLEBLOWER OFFICE\r\n\r\nHer departure comes as former Obama-era official Gary Gensler takes over the SEC and as regulators come under fire from progressives -- and even some famous investors -- for failing to do enough to protect investors.\r\n\"The program is in a really fantastic place,\" Norberg told CNN Business. \"If the staff keeps doing what they\'re doing, it\'s going to continue to be incredibly successful.\"\r\nNorberg, a former Secret Service agent, admitted that she had some doubts about just how successful the whistleblower office would be when she joined the SEC in 2012.\r\n\"With anything new, you just don\'t know at the beginning,\" said Norberg, who previously served as the office\'s deputy chief.\r\nJane Norberg, chief of the SEC&#39;s whistleblower office, is stepping down from the agency.\r\nJane Norberg, chief of the SEC\'s whistleblower office, is stepping down from the agency.\r\nRecord-breaking $114 million award to a single whistleblower\r\nFlash forward nine years and it\'s clear the whistleblower program is instrumental in helping Wall Street\'s top cop crack down on financial crime, everything from Ponzi schemes and insider trading to bribery and market manipulation.\r\nThe SEC says it has fielded more than 40,000 tips from over 130 countries since the whistleblower program\'s inception in 2012. Those tips have led to $3.9 billion in financial remedies, including more than $1.1 billion of ill-gotten gains that were returned or scheduled to be returned to investors, according to the SEC.\r\n\"We knew the tips were coming in. The question is whether the information would be actionable and lead to solid enforcement actions,\"Norberg said. \"The answer to that is clearly yes.\"\r\nDuring the first seven months of this fiscal year alone, the SEC awarded more than a quarter of a billion dollars to whistleblowers, surpassing last year\'s record sum. That means the agency has awarded a total of about $812 million since its 2012 launch. The awards are funded through sanctions paid to the SEC by securities law violators.\r\n\"It just felt like the right time for me. I\'m looking forward to a new challenge and I know the office is in great hands,\" said Norberg, who declined to share her career plans after leaving the agency.\r\nLast fall, the SEC awarded a stunning $114 million to a single whistleblower who tipped the government off to misconduct and provided \"extraordinary\" assistance in an investigation. The agency has never identified what case was connected to the award. Norberg told CNN Business at the time that she hoped the record-breaking award would encourage more tips -- and serve as a warning to Corporate America.\r\nProtecting the anonymity of whistleblowers\r\nThe SEC protects the identifies of whistleblowers to shield them from reprisals -- and it is likewise charged with punishing companies that retaliate against employees that serve as whistleblowers.\r\n\"The monetary awards get all the press, but the anti-retaliation protection and confidentiality are just as important,\" Norberg said. \"If you take away any one of those, the program may not be as successful.\"\r\nAwards range between 10% and 30% of the fines imposed in SEC actions that result from whistleblower tips. The money can help motivate people to come forward, although sometimes they reach out for other reasons, including revenge.\r\n\"They may be taking a serious professional risk by coming forward,\" Norberg said of whistleblowers who work at companies and decide to tip off the SEC. \"Some people are uncomfortable and fearful. That\'s why we take protecting confidentiality incredibly seriously.\"\r\n\'There is no cop on the beat\'\r\nDespite the success of the whistleblower program, the SEC\'s critics worry the agency isn\'t doing enough to catch financial criminals.\r\nDemocratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, a strong backer of new SEC chief Gensler, called out regulators last month over how a little-known hedge fund was able to borrow so much money that its implosion caused chaos on Wall Street.\r\n\"Regulators need to rely on more than luck to fend off risks to the financial system,\" Warren said in a statement to CNN Business at the time.\r\nEven some big shots on Wall Street are worried that regulators are asleep at the wheel.\r\nDavid Einhorn, the famed hedge fund investor, took regulators to task in a shareholder letter this week over the GameStop controversy and Elon Musk\'s 2018 run-in with the SEC.\r\n\"For the most part, there is no cop on the beat. It\'s as if there are no financial fraud prosecutors; companies and managements that are emboldened enough to engage in malfeasance have little to fear,\" Einhorn wrote in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by CNN Business. \"For the most part, quasi-anarchy appears to rule in markets.\"\r\n\'Like pulling teeth\'\r\nThe SEC declined to comment on the Einhorn letter, but it\'s clear the whistleblower program will be central to any efforts to step up enforcement.\r\nOne way to make the program even more effective would be to speed up the process of paying out awards, which can be painfully slow.\r\nStephen M. Kohn, a whistleblower attorney and partner at Kohn, Kohn & Colapinto, said he has had clients that have waited more than six years after coming forward for their money.\r\nBank of America CEO calls for bipartisan push to study restrictive voting laws\r\nBank of America CEO calls for bipartisan push to study restrictive voting laws\r\n\"It can be like pulling teeth. The delays are highly destructive,\" said Kohn, who did not blame Norberg or the office itself for the delays.\r\nInstead, he pointed to a lengthy process that allows the SEC to drag out determining the validity of whistleblower claims long after the agency has punished the wrongdoers.\r\nStill, Kohn applauded Norberg for making the SEC\'s whistleblower office a \"model\" for the rest of the nation.\r\n\"She has totally got it, and put together a remarkable program,\" said Kohn, who has worked with Norberg. \"There is a real understanding of the stress these whistleblowers are under.\"', '2021-04-16', 8),
(20, 'Apple\'s $200 million fund aims to fight climate change and boost business', 'Apple has announced a $200 million investment fund designed to remove carbon emissions from the atmosphere and support sustainable forestry — and to generate financial returns for the company.', 'By Clare Duffy', 'Apple has announced a $200 million investment fund designed to remove carbon emissions from the atmosphere and support sustainable forestry — and to generate financial returns for the company.\r\n\r\nCalled the Restore Fund, the effort aims to remove 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year, equivalent to the fuel used by more than 200,000 passenger cars annually. The project could also act as an important model for other corporations by demonstrating the ability to profit from investments in the environment.\r\n\"The idea of having a return is important for the planet,\" Apple\'s vice president for Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives Lisa Jackson said in an interview with CNN\'s Christine Romans that aired Friday.\r\n\"Because if you really want businesses to engage, if you want business to really turn around and do this at scale ... it has to be because there\'s a return on that investment,\" Jackson said. \"Otherwise, it\'s just philanthropy. And so much of what we\'re doing at Apple is showing that the business of doing right by the planet is good business.\"\r\nAn investment in sustainable forestry\r\nThe Restore Fund will generate returns by investing in developing and conserving sustainable \"working forests\" that both remove carbon from the atmosphere as they grow, and also produce trees for building materials, paper and other uses. Apple\'s packaging, for example, has since 2017 been made entirely of virgin wood fiber from \"responsibly managed working forests\" — the same kinds it plans to invest in through the fund.\r\nApple (AAPL) established the fund alongside Goldman Sachs (GS), which will manage it, and the nonprofit Conservation International, a co-investor that will ensure the projects it funds are subject to \"strict environmental and societal standards.\"\r\n\"Those are renewable products if the forest is grown in a way that it\'s sustained,\" Jackson said. \"What we\'re really saying with the Restore fund is: here is a way for us to invest in doing forestry the right way. That supports the planet, it supports returns and it supports communities, these people who work in the forestry industry.\"\r\nApple plans to be totally carbon neutral by 2030 \r\nApple plans to be totally carbon neutral by 2030\r\nThe Restore Fund builds on Apple\'s previous commitments aimed at fighting climate change.\r\nSince 2018, the company has said its retail stores, data centers and corporate offices all run on 100% clean energy. The company is also changing the materials with which it builds products to more environmentally friendly options. And by 2030, Apple says it will make its global corporate footprint entirely carbon neutral, including its supply chain, manufacturing processes and products.\r\nAll of those changes are being made, Jackson said, not just because the nearly $2.3 trillion corporation wants to give back to the earth, but also because they\'re good for business.\r\n\"All of those things were done with an eye toward return,\" she said. \"The truth of the matter is that clean energy is cheaper, and cleaner. And so if we can show companies that this is good for business, then you\'re not having to choose between your bottom line and doing well by the planet.\"\r\nApple as \'a force to advance\' equality\r\nThe news of Apple\'s latest sustainability effort also comes at a time when many corporations are engaging on a number of other progressive topics, including voting rights and the prospect of raising corporate taxes.\r\nExecutives from more than 100 companies, including fellow big tech giants Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR), Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN), issued a public statement earlier this month opposing any measures that deny eligible voters the right to cast ballots. The statement followed legislation in Georgia, Texas and other states where Republican lawmakers are trying to clamp down on ballot access.\r\nApple was not among the statement\'s signatories. But on Monday, Will Smith and Antoine Fuqua announced that production of their film \"Emancipation,\" which was sold to Apple Studios, would leave Georgia over the state\'s restrictive voting law, a decision Jackson said the company supports.\r\n\"The right to be in a democracy is a sacred civil right ... we want to see every single person have the right to vote,\" Jackson said. \"Companies like ours, we stand for action on climate change. We also have taken a strong stand that there are still inequities, systemic injustices, that are tied to race around education and criminal justice and economic opportunity. And we want Apple to be a force to advance those causes and to finally end these inequities.\"\r\nJackson deflected on the question of whether Apple supports raising corporate taxes, which has been posited as a way to help pay for the Biden Administration\'s ambitious infrastructure package and which has received support from leaders at Amazon (AMZN) and BlackRock.\r\n\"I think that the economy can find a way to make the investments that it needs,\" she said, adding, \"I\'m not going to speak to specifics at this point.\"\r\nHowever, she did say that the infrastructure plan, which would involve investment in high-tech manufacturing, clean energy and transportation systems designed for electric vehicles, would be good for the country and for Corporate America.\r\n\"There\'s so many good ideas that are part of the technology and the economy we need for the future so we can stay the cutting edge country that we\'ve always been,\" Jackson said. \"I do think that investments in infrastructure have always been seen as an investment in the future and quite good for business, so we need to come together as a country and figure that out.\"', '2021-04-17', 8);
